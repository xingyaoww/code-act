To solve the task, I need to find and take a statue, then find and use a desklamp.
First I need to find a statue. A statue is more likely to appear in dresser (1), coffeetable (1), sidetable (1-2), diningtable (1), sofa (1), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one.
</thought>
<execute>
for loc_to_check in ["dresser 1", "coffeetable 1", "sidetable 1", "sidetable 2", "diningtable 1", "sofa 1", "garbagecan 1"]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)

    if "statue" in res:
        print(f"Found a statue in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
</execute>

Observation:

for loc_to_check in ["sidetable 1", "sidetable 2", "coffeetable 1", "diningtable 1"]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)

    if "desklamp" in res:
        print(f"Found a desklamp in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
