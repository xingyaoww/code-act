To solve the task, I need to find and take a pan, then cool it with fridge, then put it in stoveburner.
First I need to find a pan. An pan is more likely to appear in stoveburner (1-4), sinkbasin (1), diningtable (1), countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-16), drawer (1-5). I can check one by one.

for loc_to_check in [
    *[f"stoveburner {i}" for i in range(1, 5)],
    "sinkbasin 1", "diningtable 1",
    "countertop 1", "countertop 2",
    *[f"cabinet {i}" for i in range(1, 17)],
    *[f"drawer {i}" for i in range(1, 6)]
]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)

    if "pan" in res:
        print(f"Found a pan in {loc_to_check}.")
